## **About me**
### Hi, I'm Mikita and I'm a beginner web developer. After working as an engineer for several years, I realized that I wanted to work in a different industry. Remembering that I studied programming at school, I decided to change my profession and start learning again. Although my programming abilities are not great, I am sure that my desire to learn and perseverance will lead me to success.
